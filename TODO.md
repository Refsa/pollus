		- f.ex. shader imports, scene files, etc.
		- [x] tracking dependencies/dependents
		- [x] load order dependency
		- [x] improved status on loading
	- [ ] multiple AssetIO in AssetServer
		- supply prefix handling for 'asset://', 'userdata://', etc.
	- [-] Hot reloading
	- [ ] Preprocessor
		- [ ] Preload assets before AssetLoader runs
			- If an asset requires loading some other data
			- ex. a shader with imports
- Plugins
	- [x] Defer applying plugins
	- [x] Plugin dependency graph
	- [ ] dependency handling using world.AddPlugin from a plugin

	- [x] Events
	- [x] Commands
	- [x] Improve spawn commands
		- should be able to chain commands that works on entities
		- i.e. spawn -> set parent and other similar operations
		- could be implemented on EntityBuilder
	- [-] State Flags

	- [-] Serialization
		- world snapshot, scene serialization later
		- binary format
	- [x] Required Components
		- [ ] optimize
		- RequiredAttribute to define required components
		- might need a Default on IComponent
		- source generator to establish some graph type that defines what is needed
		- need some work on the bundle part to make this actually nice to use
	- [ ] Bundle
		- struct that can hold several components to be added as one
		- needs a source generator for IEntityBuilder
- Scene
	- [-] Scene Layout
		- [x] entities
		- [ ] resources
		- [-] asset prefetch
			- Handle<T> is supported to load assets, scene will not be fully loaded until all assets are loaded
		- [x] reproduce hierarchy layout?
			- scenes are created as parent/child hierarchies
			- scenes can contain references to scenes
	- [-] Serialization
		- [-] Human readable format
			- using JSON right now, but auto-formatters doesnt create a very readable layout
			- YAML/KDL might provide a more readable layout
	- [-] Scene Spawning
		- [ ] check for sub scene loops
- UI
	- [x] IMGUI
		- [ ] handle some function signature mismatches

	- [ ] Rendering Stage/Frame Graph
		- [x] frame graph builder
		- [x] create transient resources
		- [x] graph execution
		- [ ] transient resource lifetime/cleanup
			- track last read/write
			- release unused resources
		- [ ] external resource handling
			- keep in cache for just the frame or cleanup when not used
			- explicit mark on resource
		- [ ] ensure stable ordering
		- [ ] debug groups
		- [ ] move to builder pattern for better readability and resource handling
	- [ ] Render target
		- [x] frame graph color targets
	- [ ] Meshes
