- Assets
	- [-] Async loading
		- [x] LoadAsync to load from a Task
		- [ ] async support in AssetLoader
	- [ ] Streaming / partial loading
	- [ ] dependency / hierarchy
		- an asset might require one or more other assets to complete its loading
		- f.ex. shader imports, scene files, etc.
		- [x] tracking dependencies/dependents
		- [ ] load order dependency
		- [ ] improved status on loading
	- [ ] multiple AssetIO in AssetServer
		- supply prefix handling for 'asset://', 'userdata://', etc.

	- [-] Hierarchies
	- [x] Events
	- [x] Commands
	- [x] Improve spawn commands
		- should be able to chain commands that works on entities
		- i.e. spawn -> set parent and other similar operations
		- could be implemented on EntityBuilder

	- [-] Scene Layout
		- [x] entities
		- [ ] resources
		- [-] asset prefetch
			- Handle<T> is supported to load assets
		- [x] reproduce hierarchy layout?
			- scenes are created as parent/child hierarchies
			- scenes can contain references to scenes
	- [-] Serialization
		- [-] Human readable format
			- using JSON right now, but auto-formatters doesnt create a very readable layout
			- YAML/KDL might provide a more readable layout
	- [-] Scene Spawning
		- [ ] check for sub scene loops
- UI
	- [x] IMGUI
		- [ ] handle some function signature mismatches
		- [x] Implement as Render Pass

	- [ ] Rendering Stage/Frame Graph
		- [x] frame graph builder
		- [x] create transient resources
		- [x] graph execution
		- [ ] transient resource lifetime/cleanup
			- track last read/write
			- release unused resources
		- [ ] external resource handling
			- keep in cache for just the frame or cleanup when not used
			- explicit mark on resource
		- [ ] ensure stable ordering
		- [ ] debug groups
		- [ ] move to builder pattern for better readability and resource handling
