- Assets
	- [ ] Async loading
	- [ ] Streaming / partial loading
	- [ ] dependency / hierarchy
		- an asset might require one or more other assets to complete its loading
		- f.ex. shader imports, scene files, etc.
	- [ ] multiple AssetIO in AssetServer
		- supply prefix handling for 'asset://', 'userdata://', etc.

			- track last read/write
			- release unused resources
		- [ ] external resource handling
